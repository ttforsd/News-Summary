## How It Works

This is a hobby project built to experiment with automated content generation and LLMs.

1.  A script automatically fetches the latest articles from BBC and CNBC.
2.  The article content is processed by an LLM to generate a concise summary.
3.  These summaries are then automatically published to the GitHub Pages site.
