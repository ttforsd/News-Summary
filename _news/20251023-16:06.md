## Executive Summary

Global geopolitical tensions remain high as the US imposed new sanctions on Russia's oil sector and cancelled planned talks with President Putin, while also escalating its anti-drug operations in the Pacific which strain ties with Colombia. In the Middle East, a contentious Israeli parliamentary move towards West Bank annexation drew strong US warnings, even as the UN's top court emphasized Israel's obligation to facilitate aid to Gaza, where the WHO warns of a "generational crisis."

Economically, China outlined a five-year plan prioritizing domestic consumption and tech self-reliance amid ongoing trade disputes with the US, which itself is considering software export curbs. European markets saw gains driven by strong corporate earnings, particularly in luxury and automotive sectors. In technology, a new European space merger aims to rival Starlink, while global tech leaders urge a pause on "superintelligence" AI development, highlighting growing concerns over advanced AI's future.
