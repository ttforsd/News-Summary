    *   Details: Maduro and Flores were flown to New York to face charges of narco-terrorism, cocaine importation, and weapons offenses. The operation involved months of planning, replica safe house training, over 150 aircraft, and strikes on military sites and power infrastructure.
    *   US Stance: President Trump stated the US would "run" Venezuela for a "safe, proper and judicious transition." Secretary of State Rubio clarified the US would use leverage from its oil blockade to meet policy goals, not directly govern, and hinted at potential further military action.
    *   International Reaction: Global leaders, including China, Russia, Iran, and several Latin American countries, strongly condemned the US action as a violation of international law and a dangerous precedent.
        *   Cuba: Reported 32 Cuban citizens, identified as part of Maduro's security team (Armed Forces and interior ministry), were killed during the US raid.

        *   Context: Rodríguez is backed by Maduro's inner circle, potentially offering a smoother transition perceived by US officials.
        *   Opposition: Trump dismissed Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, stating she lacked the "support or respect" to lead.
        *   Precedent Concerns: Analysts debate if the US action sets a precedent for China regarding Taiwan or Russia in Ukraine, despite China's condemnation of the US as "hegemonic."

## Global Economic & Market Movers

*   **Venezuela's Oil Future:** Maduro's arrest creates significant uncertainty over Venezuela's vast oil reserves, primarily controlled by state-owned PDVSA with some foreign partnerships.
    *   Investment Outlook: If a pro-US government is installed and sanctions ease, Chevron is best positioned for expansion. Reviving production from current levels (~950,000 bpd) to historic highs would require years and billions of dollars in investment ($10 billion annually).
    *   Market Impact: Short-term oil supply risks are limited, though political chaos could disrupt exports. Sanctions relief might lead to an initial increase from stored oil, but a sustained recovery would be gradual.
