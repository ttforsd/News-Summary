## International Relations & Diplomacy

*   **US-Europe Tensions Over Greenland & Tariffs:**
    *   President Trump vowed to impose 10% tariffs from February 1, rising to 25% from June 1, on imports from eight European NATO nations (UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, Netherlands, Finland).
    *   Tariffs are explicitly linked to these nations opposing his demand for the "Complete and Total purchase of Greenland," which Trump cited as vital for "National and World Security."
    *   European leaders, including Denmark's Prime Minister and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, firmly rejected the threats as "unacceptable" and an attempt to "blackmail," affirming Greenland's self-determination.
    *   The EU is considering retaliatory tariffs, potentially up to €93 billion, or activating its "Anti-Coercion Instrument" as a "trade bazooka" against the US.
