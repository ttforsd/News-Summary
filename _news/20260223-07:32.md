## Global Economic & Market Movers

*   **US Tariff Policy Shifts and Market Reaction**
    *   The US Supreme Court struck down most of President Trump's tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
    *   The ruling, 6-3, asserted Congress's power to create new taxes, not the President via IEEPA.
    *   Trump immediately announced new 10% global tariffs under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, then increased them to 15%.
    *   These new tariffs are temporary (150 days); existing tariffs under Section 232 (e.g., steel, aluminum) remain in effect.
    *   The EU stated it would not accept increased tariffs, while India postponed a trade visit to Washington to assess the impact.
    *   The issue of refunding an estimated $175 billion collected under the invalidated tariffs remains unresolved, likely leading to litigation.
    *   Market reaction has been relatively restrained; strategists recommend patience amidst the "noise."
    *   Safe-haven assets like gold inched up, while Bitcoin fell over 3% due to tariff and geopolitical uncertainties.
    *   European stocks are predicted to open lower, but Asia-Pacific markets largely absorbed the news, with South Korea's Kospi hitting a new high.
    *   Analysts believe the ruling may increase China's negotiating leverage ahead of an April summit with Trump.

    *   Major tech companies (Amazon, Meta, Alphabet) are dramatically increasing AI capital expenditure, with aggregated spending potentially reaching $770bn in 2026.

    *   Investors are concerned this "AI debt binge" challenges the traditionally strong balance sheets of tech giants.
    *   OpenAI has revised its compute spending target to $600bn by 2030 (from $1.4tn), aiming for over $280bn in revenue by then.

*   **India's Budget Fast Fashion Boom**
    *   India's organized fast fashion industry is rapidly expanding in smaller towns, driven by value-conscious consumers.
    *   Brands like Reliance Trends and Tata's Zudio are offering affordable, branded apparel, drawing customers away from traditional bazaars.
    *   Zudio, for example, saw its revenue exceed $1 billion by mid-2025, attributed to rapid store expansion and quick inventory turnover.
    *   This growth is more a "wallet-shift" from unbranded goods rather than a significant increase in overall consumption.
